## Handwritten Digit Recognizer

* Data used in this application is a subset of MNIST handwritten digit images (0 to 9), so the number of labels is 10.

* There are 5000 images of size (20,20) each and there are 5000 corresponding labels.
  - X: 5000,400
  - y: 5000,1
  
* For the given dataset, we get an accuracy of 94.96%

* Output:
